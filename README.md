# general-assembly-movie-search
A (very) quick app that lets users search for movies, see detailed information about movies, and save favorites for later.

This app is running at https://general-assembly-movie-search.herokuapp.com/.

Because I was trying to get this back to you quickly over a holiday weekend, there are several quick fixes that I haven't done:

* The detail views can be constructed/inserted into the DOM earlier, and toggled visible/invisible as needed
* The success messages should similarly be a single element whose visibility is toggled
* The main page should display whether something is already a favorite, instead having a "remove from favorites" button, maybe with a nice star icon too
* The CSS is terrible, just enough to differentiate open from closed.
